# MyProject - Employee Database

To create my project, I have utilized the following:

A Trello board with completed user stories.
A relational database, consisting of at least two tables that model a  one to many relationship
Clear documentation of the design phase, app architecture and risk assessment
A python-based functional application that follows best practices and design principles
Test suites for the application, which will include automated tests for validation of the application
A front-end website, created using Flask
Code integrated into a Version Control System which will be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

Flask
SQLALCHEMY
MySQL database
Ginga template
